\title{Create a reporter callback.}
\usage{
make_reporter(report_every = 100, min_cost = 0,
  reltol = sqrt(.Machine$double.eps), plot_fn = NULL,
  normalize_cost = TRUE, keep_costs = FALSE, extra_costs = NULL,
  verbose = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{report_every}{Number of steps between callback invocations.}

\item{min_cost}{If the cost function used by the embedding falls below this
value, the optimization process is halted.}

\item{reltol}{If the relative tolerance of the cost function between
consecutive reports falls below this value, the optimization process is
halted.}

\item{plot_fn}{Function for plotting embedding. Signature should be
\code{plot_fn(out)} where \code{out} is the output data list. Return value
of this function is ignored.}

\item{normalize_cost}{If \code{TRUE}, the cost calculated by the cost
function will be normalized and both values logged.}

\item{keep_costs}{If \code{TRUE}, all costs (and the iteration number at
which they were calculated) will be stored on result list returned by the
reporter callback. This can be exported by the embedding algorithm.}

\item{extra_costs}{List containing the names of cost functions to be reported,
in addition to the cost associated with the embedding method, which will
always be logged. Possible cost functions include:
\describe{
 \item{\code{\link{kl_cost}}}{Kullback-Leibler divergence.}
}
Note that note all costs are compatible with all embedding methods, because
they may require specific matrices or other values to be precalculated in the
Input and Output data. See the help text for each cost function for details.}

\item{verbose}{If \code{TRUE}, report results such as cost values
will be logged to screen. If set to false, you will have to export the
report from the embedding routine to access any of the information.}
}
\value{
Reporter callback used by the embedding routine. The callback has the
signature \code{reporter(iter, inp, out, method, report)} where:
 \item{\code{iter}}{Iteration number.}
 \item{\code{inp}}{Input data.}
 \item{\code{method}}{Embedding method.}
 \item{\code{report}}{Report from previous reporter invocation.}
The return value of the callback is an updated
version of the \code{report} passed as a parameter to the callback. A list
containing:
 \item{\code{stop_early}}{If \code{TRUE} then optimization stopped before
 the maximum number of iterations specified by the embedding algorithm.}
 \item{\code{reltol}}{Relative convergence value.}
 \item{\code{iter}}{Iteration number that the callback was invoked at.}
 \item{\code{cost}}{Cost for this reporter.}
 \item{\code{norm}}{Normalized cost for the most recent iteration. Only
 present if \code{normalize_cost} was \code{TRUE}.}
 \item{\code{costs}}{Matrix of all costs calculated for all invocations of
 the reporter callback and the value of \code{iter} the reporters were
 invoked at. Only present if \code{keep_costs} was \code{TRUE}.}

The result list is reused on each invocation of the callback so that the cost
from the previous report can be compared with that of the current report,
allowing for relative convergence early stopping, and appending of costs
if \code{keep_costs} is \code{TRUE}.
}
\description{
Factory function which returns a function which will be invoked by the
embedding algorithm at regular intervals during the optimization.

\examples{
# reporter calculation every 100 steps of optimization, log cost and also the
# normalized cost
make_reporter(report_every = 100, normalize_cost = TRUE)

# Stop optimization early if relative tolerance of costs falls below 0.001
make_reporter(report_every = 100, reltol = 0.001)

# For s1k dataset, plot 2D embedding at every reporter, with "Label" factor
# to identify each point on the plot
make_reporter(report_every = 100, plot_fn = make_plot(s1k, "Label"))

# For iris dataset, plot 2D embedding at every reporter, with first two
# characters of the "Species" factor to identify each point on the plot
make_reporter(report_every = 100,
              plot_fn = make_plot(iris, "Species", make_label(2)))

# Keep all costs calculated during reporters, can be exported from the
# embedding routine and plotted or otherwise used.
make_reporter(report_every = 100, keep_costs = TRUE)

# Should be passed to the reporter argument of an embedding function:
\dontrun{
 embed_sim(reporter = make_reporter(report_every = 100,
                                    normalize_cost = TRUE,
                                    plot_fn = make_plot(iris, "Species")),
                                    ...)
}
