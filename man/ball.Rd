\description{
Simulation data.
}
\details{
Creates a series of points sampled from a 3D spherical volume.

Labels go from \code{0} to \code{nlabels - 1}. Points are classified into
labels based on their distance from the origin, where that distance is
divided into \code{nlabels} equal lengths. That results in unequal
volumes and hence unequal populations of the labels.
