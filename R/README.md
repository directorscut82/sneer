# sneer

sneer is a pure R package for doing Stochastic Neighbor Embedding and related 
techniques, including the popular t-distributed variant (TSNE).

Its basic code was based heavily on Justin Donaldson's 
[tsne R package](https://github.com/cran/tsne), but is now mangled so far 
beyond its original form that I've made it a separate project rather than a 
fork.

Installing:
```R
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("jlmelville/sneer")
```
